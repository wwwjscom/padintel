<p class="announcement">Currently we only search the DC and Chicago areas.  <a href="mailto:padintel@gmail.com">Tell us</a> if you want us to search your area too.</p>
<h2>Define your dream apartment, and we investigate.</h2>
<h4>Here's how it works:
  <ol>
    <li>Select what features you need, want, and dislike</li>
      <p class="small_note">Ex. Automatically remove apartments with, say, carpeting.</p>
    <li>We crawl apartment websites for matches.</li>
      <p class="small_note">Our investigators are smart enough to search for multiple ways to say the same thing.<br />For example, if you want carpet, they search for "carpet" or "carpeting" or "wall-to-wall" etc.</p>
    <li>Only matching results are shown to you</li>
  </ol>
