<h2>Feature Requests/Feedback</h2>
<p>If you find a way to make PadIntel better, like it, hate it, or just want to say hi, you can get in touch with me via <a href="mailto:padintel@gmail.com">email</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/padintel">twitter</a>.</p>

<h2>Who</h2>
<p>PadIntel was started by <a href="http://twitter.com/jsoo">@jsoo</a> to help in his apartment search.</p>

<h2>What</h2>
<p>PadIntel is designed to search craigslist for multiple ways to say the same thing.  The hope is that it'll dramatically cut back on what you have to look through to find your apartment.</p>
<h2>Where</h2>
<p>Currently it only searches the Washington DC area, but that can be changed if people express interest.  If you want your region to be index, just <a href="mailto:padintel@gmail.com">email me</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/padintel">tweet me</a>.</p>
<h2>When</h2>
<p>PadIntel was started during the summer of 2011.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>Because I had a terrible time trying to find an apartment that had no carpeting in it.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>It uses some machine learning, written in Rails hosted with Heroku.</p>
